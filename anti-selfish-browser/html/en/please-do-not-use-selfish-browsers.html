<h2>Why do this page appear?</h2>
<p>Self-private browser is generally existed about the following rogue behavior, have you encountered?</p>
<ul style="line-height:2;">
<li>Various pop-up advertisements, close buttons are set to hide, not necessarily all turned off, and they will be replaced</li>
<li>Tampering the web, embed advertising in the web page (Search Filing, Information, etc.).Even with someone else's webpage, then replace it for your selfish advertisement</li>
<li>Process resident background (in order to push advertising, and secretly collect privacy data), it cannot completely exit</li>
<li>Secret to abuse user data, share to partners (shopping platforms, etc.), make big data, cooked (using user information collected by algorithm) and making data portraits, especially those who are not sensitive to price, malicious price),Even sale of privacy data</li>
<li>More and more bloated, built-in sick features (such as "Alipay Controls", you can't delete</li>
<li>A knife is cut "in accordance with China's Mainland Policy Shielding", even if you are not in the mainland.Long arm jurisdiction</li>
<li>Malicious masks some web pages.Review according to your selfish interests (eg, in violation of the laws and regulations, it is a pro-maintenance of the Chinese mainland labor law by violation of laws and regulations) ......</li>
<li>Built-in search engines cannot be changed, or only a few search engines</li>
<li>Check when checking to check if it is a "default browser", and hints to the user in the name of "security" to set his home browser, navigation to the default.</li>
<li>Bundle to install some other software (game box, anti-virus, music, video, information, navigation full bucket, etc.).And this browser itself may be mounted to the system (difficult to uninstall) by the virus bundle.</li>
<li>Use a rogue class certificate.In history, the CNNIC certificate has also appeared in the 12306 website untrusted and cannot be paid.There is also a privacy leak risk.</li>
<li>Many selfish browsers, no core technology, using other browser kernels, but the kernel update is slow, safe risks.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<p>This page is to prompt you, the browser may have rogue behavior, it is recommended that you replace it.</p>
<p>If you want to exercise to endurance, pursue is physically made, you can continue to use them as the preferred browser</p>
<p>If you don't know what to change the browser means, it is recommended to ask some friends who are skilled in the computer.</p>

<h2>A selfish browser</h2>
<p>The desire of capitalists is unlimited.The capitalists behind the private browser are like fascists to ordinary people.After World War II, Martino Morr Pastor has written such an inscription: "When they kill the Communist Party, I didn't make a sound, because I am not a Communist Party; after they kill the Jew, I have no sound, because I am not a Jew; then I will kill.Catholics, I still keep silent, because I am not a Catholic; Finally, when they start to deal with me, no one speaks for me ... ".</p>
<p>If you don't break out in silence, you will die in silence.I hope everyone will drive friends around to boycott the selfish browser.A single spark can start a prairie fire.</p>
<p>In order to compatibility with a variety of selfish browsers, web designers also need to do a lot of code work.So, please boycott the selfish browser with us!</p>
